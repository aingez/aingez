Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🧑‍💻

### About Me:
- 💻 I write code and hope it works.
- 🚀 If it compiles, it's good. If it runs, it's better. If it passes tests, I’m a wizard. 🧙‍♂️
- 🐛 Professional bug creator by day, bug exterminator by night.
- ⚙️ My life is powered by oliang ☕ and commits. 🔄

- Fun Facts:
- 👾 My code might not solve world problems, but it sure causes them. 
- 🔥 My commits are fire. My repos? A dumpster fire.
